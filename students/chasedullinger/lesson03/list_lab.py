# Series 1 ###

# Create a list that contains “Apples”, “Pears”, “Oranges” and “Peaches”.

# Ask the user for another fruit and add it to the end of the list.
response = input("Enter a new item for the list > ")

# Display the list.
print(list_of_fruit)

# Ask the user for a number and display the number back to the user and
# the fruit corresponding to that number (on a 1-is-first basis).
# Remember that Python uses zero-based indexing, so you will need to correct.

# Add another fruit to the beginning of the list using “+” and display the list

# Add another fruit to the beginning of the list using insert()
# and display the list.

# Display all the fruits that begin with “P”, using a for loop.

# Once found, delete all occurrences.)

# Series 3 ###

# fruit in the list (making the fruit all lowercase).

# of those two values (a while loop is good here)

# Series 4 ###
# Make a new list with the contents of the original, but with all the letters
# in each item reversed.
new_list_of_fruit = []
for fruit in list_of_fruit:
    new_list_of_fruit.append(fruit[::-1])
