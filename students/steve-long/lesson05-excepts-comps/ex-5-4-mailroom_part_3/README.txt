Directions:

Run ./mailroom3.py from terminal window and pay attention to the user prompts.
All functionality is implemented in a sensible UI pattern. There are no
discernible changes from mailroom2; changes are structural: refinement of
exception handling, use of list comprehension, and consolidation of a small
amount of code.
