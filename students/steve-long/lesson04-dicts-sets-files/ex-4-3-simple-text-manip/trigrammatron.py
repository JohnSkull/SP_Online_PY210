# Simple Text Manipulation (trigrammatron.py)
# Steve Long 2020-10-16 | v0
#
# Requirements:
# =============
#
#   Trigrams
#   --------
#
#   Trigrams can be used to mutate text into new, surreal, forms. But what
#   heuristics do we apply to get a reasonable result?
#
#   The Problem
#   -----------
#
#   Trigram analysis is very simple. Look at each set of three adjacent words
#   in a document. Use the first two words of the set as a key, and remember
#   the fact that the third word followed that key. For example, given the
#   input...
#
#     I wish I may I wish I might
#
#   ...will yield the following relationship...
#
#     "I wish" => ["I", "I"]
#     "wish I" => ["may", "might"]
#     "may I"  => ["wish"]
#     "I may"  => ["I"]
#
#   To generate new text from this analysis, choose a word pair as a
#   starting point. Use this pair of words to look up the list of next words,
#   choose a random element from this list, and append it to the word pair
#   to form a phrase...
#
#     "I may I"
#
#   Use the last two words of this phrase as the next key ("may I") which is
#   mapped to word "wish". The next phrase becomes...
#
#     "may I wish"
#
#   For this exercise, try implementing a trigram algorithm that generates a
#   couple of hundred words of text using a book-sized file as input.
#
#   Objectives
#   ----------
#
#   The assignment includes using mapping data structures and determining the
#   heuristics for processing the text. What do we do with punctuation?
#   Paragraphs? Do we have to implement backtracking if we choose a next word
#   that turns out to be a dead end?
#
#   Developing Your Solution
#   ------------------------
#
#   This assignment has two parts: the trigrams exercise itself and the  text
#   processing to get a full book in shape for processing.
#
#   A large data file is required for processing.
#
#   The source text file may require cleanup prior
#   to building the trigram map.
#
#   There may be multiple occurrences of the 2-word pair mapped to different
#   third words; capture all of the third words.
#
#   Several additional cleanup operations may be implemented:
#
#     - Strip out punctuation? - If you do this, what about contractions, i.e.
#       the appostrophe in "can't" vs. a single quotation mark â€“ which are the
#       same character.
#
#     - Remove capitalization? - If you do this, what about "I"? And proper
#       nouns?
#
#     - Any other ideas you may have.
#
# Assumptions:
# ============
#
#   There is enough ambiguity in the requirements to allow a degree of
#   artistic freedom. The implementation description reveals some of the
#   choices.
#
# Implementation:
# ===============
#
#   Trigrammatron sounded like an insidious title for the script, so I used it.
#
#   The filtering the text file data is implemented with the goal of providing
#   a set of words with minimal punctuation and symbolic characters (chars)
#   in order to generate at least a few sensible phrases. Data is processed on
#   a line basis, not with every word of the document chained together.
#   chaining the entire document word list into a single list only generates
#   additional nonsensical phrases. The word1+word2 key maps to a list
#   of unique word3 values.
#
#   *Output. The script accepts an input file name and provides the ability to
#   use the the trigram data structure three different ways. See the
#   documentation string for function run_trigrammatron_demo_ui below.
#
#   *File clean-up. File cleanup is extensive. Sequences of allowed and
#   disallowed substrings are collected into sets for checking and line, word,
#   and character substitution. It does not include removing item numbers and
#   certain other "technical" text (the marginal return on that time
#   expenditure was not deemed worthwhile.)
#
#   *Handling missing values. Function show_trigrams_haiku chains word 2 and 3
#   of a trigram into the key for the next phrase. If there is no entry for
#   that key (due to the word filtering process or because the word pair
#   appeared at the end of a line) then the output terminates.
#
#   Style. Function run_trigrammatron_demo_ui provides a crude user interface.
#
#   Checked with flake8.
#
# Script Usage:

# Issues:

#
#   Requirements description should be simpler (it's a long explanation
#   for a simple concept).
