Hello,

My name is Cody Yarger and I am a husband and father of two small boys. We recently moved to Portland OR after 9 years in
the Seattle area. We love to be outside, camping, hiking, biking, surfing, swimming and playing!

My educational background is in Mechanical Engineering. I have worked in aerospace for 
the past 14 years mostly as a structures analyst. I have always enjoyed times in my career when I had the opportunity
to solve problems by writing code, primairly in VBA or in-house tools. Although I have taken several Python classes
I am using this period of unemployment (COVID Related) to get more serious about developing this skill to a marketable
level. I have an organic interest in data science and analytics, blockchain (GPU mining Etherium since 2016) and really
just like science. My hopes is to break into one of these fields and can see myself supporting aerospace/aviation, healthcare,
or research science or perhaps one of the multitude of applications I don't konw about yet.

2020 has been CRAZY, for everyone, so finidng myself unemployed, in a new city...why not try to pursue a new
career. Here we go!

That's it.
Cody
